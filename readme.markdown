#Baseline

Baseline is a simple development tool that helps establish vertical rhythm in web app/site pages. Baseline
inserts a canvas element in to the page, then draws line rules according to a base line-height set by the developer.
With these guides in place, font-size, line-height, margin, and padding settings can be visually spot-checked to help
ensure a consistent vertical rhythm.
